This repository contains the **ordered** list of Laravel topics to learn, step-by-step, with related links.

If you want to add a topic, link, or any other suggestion, please open Issues or Pull Requests.

**Notice 1**: The same table below is also available as a database, so you would be able to transform it to any other format you want - PDF, chart, etc. See file [roadmap.sql](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/Laravel-Roadmap-Learning-Path/blob/main/roadmap.sql)

**Notice 2**: This content was filled into an adminpanel generated with our [QuickAdminPanel](https://quickadminpanel.com/) - here's a [video demo of that process on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ElUDUDRms). By purchasing QuickAdminPanel, you support my free initiatives, like this Roadmap.
